    <h2 class="section-title">Professional Summary</h2>
    <p>I am a results‑driven data science professional with more than five years of experience delivering analytics, machine learning and business intelligence solutions. Currently working as a BI Engineer at Amazon, I bridge the gap between research science, data engineering and operations to fuel supply‑chain innovation at scale. My mission is to transform complex data into actionable insights that deliver faster, smarter and more efficient outcomes. Over the years I have built end‑to‑end data pipelines, forecasting models and interactive dashboards using SQL, Python, AWS and BI tools, collaborating across research, operations and program teams to deliver scalable, cost‑effective solutions.</p>
